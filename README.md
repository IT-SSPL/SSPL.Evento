 PWA application - a collection of all the most necessary information
</p>

TripApp is a PWA ([Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps)) application built on the Next.js 14 framework, providing fast and responsive web application performance. It uses Supabase, which is a comprehensive set of tools that provides back-end functions with a Postgres database. Our goal is to provide users with easy access to all necessary information about the event that are currently being organized.
